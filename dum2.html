<font color="white"><font size="4">Algebraic Eqaution statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables
the algebraic operations,namely,addition,subtraction,multiplication,division, raising to a power, and extract of a root. Example
 are x<sup>2</sup> + 1 and (y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy - y<sup>1</sup?>)/(x - 1) = 12.
 An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the  form axn + bxn <sup>-1</sup>+,,,+ <sub>gx</sub>+ h = k.
 they many as sulotion as their digree (<em>n</em>), and the search of their sulotions stemulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. 
 equations like x sin (x) = that involved nonalgebraic operations, such as algorithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.	</font>
